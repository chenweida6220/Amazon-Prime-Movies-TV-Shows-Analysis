# Key Findings
## 1. Dominance of Teen & Adult Content
- Ratings for 13+ and 16+ audiences make up the majority of the catalog (over 6,000 titles).  
- This suggests Amazon Prime primarily caters to mature viewers seeking drama, action, and thriller content.
## 2. Family-Friendly Gap
- Only about 1,900 titles are rated for general or kid audiences, less than the 13+ category alone.  
- Family-oriented TV content remains limited compared to competitors like Disney+.
## 3. Movies Define the Platform
- Movies make up ~81% of the total library, meaning the platform’s overall content strategy is film-centric.  
- TV shows represent a smaller but higher-value portion focused on original and exclusive series.
## 4. Rapid Content Expansion Post-2010
- The dataset shows an exponential growth curve in new releases from 2010–2020, aligning with the rise of the “Streaming Wars.”  
- A temporary dip around 2020 reflects pandemic-related production slowdowns.
## 5. Genre Concentration in Drama & Comedy
- Drama and Comedy dominate, both as pure and hybrid genres (e.g., Drama, Suspense or Comedy, Drama).  
- The presence of Animation, Kids, and Documentary in the top genres shows a strategic effort to broaden appeal.
## 6. Rise of Original TV Series
- TV content saw a sharp increase after 2015, likely corresponding with Amazon’s investment in prestige original series.  
- Though TV shows form only 19% of titles, they represent the most strategically important content segment.
## 7. Unrated and Specialty Content
- About 328 titles are Not Rated (NR or TV-NR), reflecting independent, international, or classic films—an appealing niche for cinephiles.
